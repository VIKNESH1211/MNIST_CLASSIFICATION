# About the Model
The model is based on the sequential model by keras tensorflow.
The model has a Flatten layer ,  Dense layer which uses activation function Relu , one more Dense layer and finally a SoftMax layer

#About MNIST data_set
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
